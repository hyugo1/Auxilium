# Auxilium

Auxilium is a first year team project we worked on in a group of six people. The website is about creating new volunteering websites, with features such as 
1. Creating accounts using emails, with 2FA verification.
2. Posting new events and editing them, as well as uploading pictures of what the events would be
3. Displaying the description, such as where and when it is, using tools such as google maps.
